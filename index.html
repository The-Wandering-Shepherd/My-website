  <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>It is possible to turn your android device 
into an effective homelab and learning tool. After completing the steps in this tutorial you will have a secure device with all the tools necesarry to start learning Linux, web design, coding and cybersecurity tools all from your tablet or phone. At the end I have also listed free learning platforms and resorces to help you get started! This
can be done with very minimal hardware. I am 
designing this website on a $100 tablet with a 
1.8 ghz processor and 3 ghz of ram. Odds are you already have a better device!</p>

  <h2 id="Step 1: De-Google">Step 1: De-Google</h2>

    <p>I always uninstall or disable any Google or
any other applications that are not free and open
source. Google will annoy you with several 
notifications saying "calander, contacts, etc. will
not work without googles (malicious) software activated". The way
around this is to replace Googles malicious software (calculator)
for example with a FOSS replacement and set it as
default.</p> 

  <h2 id="Step 2: F-Droid">Step 2: F-Droid</h2>

<a href="https:\\www.f-droid.org"target="_blank">https:\\www.f-droid.org</a>

    <p>F-Droid is a Free and Open Source (FOSS)
app-store that I use as an alternative to the
Google-Play-Store. It will make setting up the
device and keeping it updated easier.</p>

  <h2 id="Step 3: Orbot">Step 3: Orbot</h2>

<p> Orbot is a free and open source VPN that utilizes
    the Tor Network to encrypt and anonymise your internet traffic.
    It is good operational security to be in the habit of using Orbot especially when you are connected to a public wi-fi. Orbot can be downloaded from F-Droid, although you may have to add the guardian project repository first.

  <h2 id="Step 4: Termux">Step 4: Termux</h2>

<p> Termux is a Linux Terminal Emulator which will
allow you to run Linux applications from within
your Android device. This is crucial for you to start
learning basic linux commands and for running 
security tools in the Linux Terminal. It will also
come in handy when you join a learning platform
because you can use Termux instead of their VM.</p>
